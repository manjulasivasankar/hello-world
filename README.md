# hello-world
 
git hub is a web based online repository to store our projects. it is powered by Git, which, in its turn, is a version control system to help you manage files in a versioned, distributed fashion and it  allows you to work in collaboration with other authors, review any changes they make and file or follow up with issues on the project’s files.

Github is free, having your projects available for other people to see, clone or if you allow them to, collaborating to it. You may also have your projects privately, only accessible by the folks you permit to, but then you’ll have to opt into a paid service.


So basically it has 3 key terms version control, colloboration, distributed.  

Version control software let's you have different versions of the document and you have an option to roll back to any older version at any point.

Colloboration means working with different people on the same file like Google docs.

Distributed means , it doesn't have single point of failure, if any machine is distributed system goes down , you can recreate the whole stable system with no/least lose of data. Unlike in client server model (svn) , server is a single point of failure.

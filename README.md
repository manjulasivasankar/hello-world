git hub is a web based online repository to store our projects. it is powered by Git, which, in its turn, is a version control system to help you manage files in a versioned, distributed fashion and it  allows you to work in collaboration with other authors, review any changes they make and file or follow up with issues on the project’s files.

Github is free, having your projects available for other people to see, clone or if you allow them to, collaborating to it. You may also have your projects privately, only accessible by the folks you permit to, but then you’ll have to opt into a paid service.

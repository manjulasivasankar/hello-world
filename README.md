# hello-world
 
git hub is a web based online repository to store our projects. it is powered by Git, which, in its turn, is a version control system to help you manage files in a versioned, distributed fashion and it  allows you to work in collaboration with other authors, review any changes they make and file or follow up with issues on the project’s files.

Github is free, having your projects available for other people to see, clone or if you allow them to, collaborating to it. You may also have your projects privately, only accessible by the folks you permit to, but then you’ll have to opt into a paid service.


So basically it has 3 key terms version control, colloboration, distributed.  

Version control software let's you have different versions of the document and you have an option to roll back to any older version at any point.

Colloboration means working with different people on the same file like Google docs.

Distributed means , it doesn't have single point of failure, if any machine is distributed system goes down , you can recreate the whole stable system with no/least lose of data. Unlike in client server model (svn) , server is a single point of failure. 


a social network for developers to share and collaborate with their codes. it also has feeds and followers as other social networks has...

FEATURES OF GIT:

1. distributed:
   - allows distributed development of code 
   - every developer has a local copy of entire development history and changes are copied from one repository to another. 
 
2. compatible 
    -compatible with existing systems and protocols
    - SVN & SVK repositories can be directly accessed using Git-SVN
3. non-linear(uses tree data structure and DAG to store the details of the non liner development of softwares)
    - supports non linear development of software
    -includes various techniques to navigate and visualize the non liner development history
4. branching (main feature which stand apart git with other vcs)
    -it takes only few seconds to create and merge branches
    -master branch always contains production quality code
    
5. lightweight

   -uses lossless compression techniques to compress data on clients side
6. speed


7. open source
8. reliable
9. secure
10. economic
